## About

In Egyptian belief, Anubis measured the hearts of the dead on the Scale of Justice (similar to the one in "The Substitute"),
and weighs it against the feather of Ma'at, the God of justice.
This process is said to determine whether or not the person to whom the heart belongs is worthy to enter the realm of the dead.
